# Image-Segmentation-for-Power-Line-Inspection-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
This project applies deep neural networks for image segmentation in high-voltage power line inspection. It enhances safety and reliability by automatically detecting faults, insulators, and damages from aerial images, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency in grid monitoring.
